// File: sts_metadata.js
//
// GET /admin/sts-metadata — the mock STS's own index of what it offers.
//
// IT WAS `GET /sts-metadata` AND IT MOVED INTO THE CONSOLE on 2026-08-24, which
// costs this test two things and is worth knowing before either surprises you:
//
//   * **It is behind the console gate** (`admin.authRequired`, on by default).
//     A browser with no session is redirected to the sign-in screen and a
//     caller asking for `?format=json` is refused `401 login_required` — a
//     redirect to an HTML login screen is not an answer a program can read. So
//     this file signs in the way tests/admin_api.js does, and for the same
//     reason: the point of the checks below is the comparison, so the answer is
//     to walk through the door rather than to stop reading the page.
//   * **The page is drawn by the console's shell**, so the document now carries
//     a sidebar, a breadcrumb and a gate banner around the tables. That is
//     asserted rather than tolerated — theConsoleChromeIsThere() below —
//     because "it renders" and "it renders inside the console" are different
//     claims and only one of them was asked for.
//
// The page lists every endpoint the service registers, the HTTP methods each
// accepts, and every specification it implements. That list is read from the
// running Express router rather than from a table kept by hand, and this test
// is what makes that design worth anything: it fails if the descriptions and
// the router have drifted in EITHER direction.
//
// Why both directions matter, and why a weaker test would be worthless here:
//
//   * a route registered and undescribed means the page silently understates
//     what is callable. The page reports it, and this test fails on it. Adding
//     an endpoint to this service therefore costs one entry in sts_metadata.js,
//     which is the point — an index nobody is obliged to update is an index
//     that lies.
//   * a description whose path is NOT registered is the more dangerous half:
//     the page would advertise an endpoint that answers 404. That happens on a
//     rename, which is exactly when nobody thinks to check the index.
//
// It also asserts the things a reader would take on trust: that the methods
// shown are the methods that actually answer (checked by calling them), that
// every endpoint names specifications that exist, and that the endpoints the
// OTHER documents point at are all present here — so the index cannot omit the
// very endpoints the service's own metadata advertises.
//
// Needs the STS mock and nothing else — no browser.

// /authn/login with any username, and send the cookie it sets.
//
// The role comes from `admin.openWhenEmpty`, on by default: while neither role
// group has a member, whoever signs in holds both. If some earlier job has
// granted a role to somebody else the roster is enforced and this user holds
// nothing — so the caller checks the read it makes rather than assuming, and
// the assertion says which of the two states it met.
