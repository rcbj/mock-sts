# ws-trust/

WS-Trust 1.0 through 1.4, at `/wstrust`. One file.

**ONE PARSER ANSWERS ALL FOUR VERSIONS**, and that is not a simplification. The
trust namespace alone has four versions in use, so `firstByLocal()` and
`textByLocal()` in `../common/helpers.js` match on LOCAL NAME WITH THE NAMESPACE
IGNORED. That is what lets one `RST` parser serve WS-Trust 1.0–1.4 instead of
four, and it is why those two functions are in `common/` rather than here — the
other two readers are `../ws-federation/wsfed.js`'s `wreq` and the `wresult` the
mock relying party is POSTed.

It asks `../saml/saml2.js` for the assertion it puts in an `RSTR`; it records the
`AppliesTo` as a relying party through `../common/applications.js`, and a
`AppliesTo` handed a SAML 2.0 assertion is BOTH a WS-Trust relying party AND that
assertion's service provider, so `seen()` is passed a LIST rather than called
twice — two calls would count two authentications for one act.

---

## `OnBehalfOf` and `ActAs` are TWO mechanisms now, not one with two spellings

`delegatedSubject()` used to collapse them with a `||`, and for everything that
reads it that was right — the token issued is identical either way, because this
service polices nothing. It is wrong for `/admin/delegation`, where the
difference is the whole point:

* **`wst:OnBehalfOf`** (1.3 §9.2) asks for a token ABOUT somebody. The relying
  party is handed an ordinary sign-in and cannot tell a middle tier was involved.
  IMPERSONATION.
* **`wst14:ActAs`** (1.4 §9.3) is composite by definition: the token is about
  the named subject AND says the requester is acting. DELEGATION.

So that function returns which element it found, `authenticate()` carries it out
on a `delegation` member (with the REQUESTER, who is the intermediary of the
chain and is the one party `subject` deliberately does not name), and
`handleRst()` records the act — there rather than in `authenticate()`, because
that is the first line at which the token exists and the only place that knows
the `AppliesTo`, which is the TARGET of the chain. A request carrying BOTH
elements is attributed to `OnBehalfOf`, the order the `||` always had, and the
row says so rather than choosing silently.

**Neither is authorized by anything here, and the row says that too**, in the
same field where a Kerberos row names an attribute on an account. Do not tidy
that sentence into an em dash: the asymmetry between a policed family and an
unpoliced one is the most useful thing on that page. What this service does NOT
do is put the composite fact into an `ActAs` token — nothing in the assertion
says a middle tier acted — and the row states that as a gap in the mock rather
than in the profile.

## Two rules about where a credential is read, and both were learnt the hard way

**"The observer is installed" is not the same claim as "this protocol calls the
funnel", and WS-Trust is what that cost.** Three of its paths accepted a
credential without ever reaching `recordAuthentication()`, so each produced
somebody who had authenticated here and appeared on no page and in no
directory: `Validate` and `Cancel` answered above the `authenticate()` call, a
request carrying both a UsernameToken and an `OnBehalfOf` returned at the
delegation branch before the UsernameToken had been looked at, and a `Renew`
with no security header read the assertion out of its own `RenewTarget` and
recorded that as the credential. Two rules come out of it and both generalise
to the next family: authenticate ABOVE the branch on the operation rather than
inside the branches that happen to need a subject, and look for a credential in
`wsse:Security` — anywhere else, only OUTSIDE the elements that hold somebody
else's token, since a document with four identities in it answers "which comes
first" and not "who is asking".

## There is no test for this in either repository

The parent project has `tests/wstrust.js` and
`tests/wstrust_schema_validate.js`, which drive the DEBUGGER's client side
against this endpoint. Nothing tests this module on its own, and the negatives
are where the value is: `Validate` and `Cancel` answering above the
`authenticate()` call, a document carrying both a UsernameToken and an
`OnBehalfOf`, a `Renew` with no security header. See the root `CLAUDE.md`'s Tests
section.
