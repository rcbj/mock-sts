// File: ldap_server.js
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// An embedded LDAPv3 directory server (RFC 4511), built on the node-ldapjs
// SUBMODULE beside this file rather than on a copy of it.
//
// NOTE ON THE DEPENDENCY, because it is unlike every other one here. `ldapjs`
// resolves to `./node-ldapjs`, a git submodule pinned to rcbj/node-ldapjs — see
// the `file:node-ldapjs` entry in package.json. Two consequences follow and both
// have already been paid for once:
//
//   * `git clone` of this repository does not bring it. `git submodule update
//     --init --recursive` does, and the parent project's launchers pass
//     --recursive for exactly this reason. An uninitialised submodule is an
//     EMPTY DIRECTORY, so the failure is `Cannot find module 'ldapjs'` from this
//     file — which names a package rather than a submodule.
//   * `npm install` on a `file:` dependency installs that package's
//     devDependencies too (tap, eslint and their trees — 200 packages and a
//     dozen advisories that have nothing to do with this service). Install with
//     `--omit=dev`; the Dockerfile does, and .npmrc makes a bare `npm install`
//     do the same.
//
// This module does NOT modify node-ldapjs. Everything below is handlers
// registered against its public server API, so the submodule stays a usable,
// unpatched copy of the library — which is the whole point of pinning it rather
// than vendoring a fork of its internals.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHAT THIS DIRECTORY IS FOR, AND THE ONE THING IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO.
//
// It exists to be the far end of the parent project's LDAP debugger: something
// a client can bind to, search, and write to, whose every answer is written to
// this service's log. Like everything else here it authenticates nobody —
// **every bind succeeds**, whatever DN and whatever password, including an
// anonymous one.
//
// The single exception is the literal password `invalid`, which is refused with
// LDAP_INVALID_CREDENTIALS (49). That is not a softening of "authenticates
// nobody": it is this service's standing convention, the same string the
// password grant, WS-Trust and the WS-Federation sign-in screen already reject,
// and it exists so that a negative test has something to fail on. A directory
// that could not produce a 49 would make "the bind failed" untestable, and 49 is
// the result code an LDAP client's error handling is built around.
//
// It is SCHEMALESS on purpose. No objectClass is enforced, no attribute is
// checked against a syntax, and `must`/`may` are not consulted — so a debugger
// can add an entry with whatever attributes it wants and see them come back.
// A real directory would refuse most of that, and where the difference matters
// (a missing objectClass, an unknown attribute type) it is a difference a reader
// should be told about rather than one this mock should hide by inventing a
// schema of its own. GET /ldap says so on the page.
//
// Three protocol behaviours ARE enforced, because each is a real rule whose
// absence would teach a client something false:
//
//   * an add whose PARENT does not exist is LDAP_NO_SUCH_OBJECT (32). A
//     directory is a tree, and a client that has never seen this refusal will
//     write its first entry into a real directory and not understand the error.
//   * a delete of an entry that HAS CHILDREN is LDAP_NOT_ALLOWED_ON_NONLEAF
//     (66), for the same reason.
//   * a modify naming an attribute that is not there is
//     LDAP_NO_SUCH_ATTRIBUTE (16) for `delete` and `replace`-with-values-absent,
//     and succeeds for `add`.
//
// And one that is NOT enforced, stated here rather than discovered: deleting a
// user does not remove it from the groups that list it as a `member`. Referential
// integrity is a feature of some directories and not of the protocol; OpenLDAP
// needs an overlay for it and Active Directory does it in the DSA. Leaving the
// dangling member is the honest default and is what a `member`-based group search
// will then show.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// AN LDAP OBJECT FOR EVERY USER WHO AUTHENTICATES.
//
// `LDAP_AUTOCREATE_USERS` (default ON) makes this directory grow a
// `uid=<name>,ou=users,<base>` entry the first time a person authenticates
// ANYWHERE in this service — the OAuth2 login screen, WS-Trust, WS-Federation,
// a Kerberos AS-REQ, a WebAuthn assertion. That is one hook and not twelve,
// because `admin_stats.recordAuthentication()` is already the single funnel every
// one of those call sites goes through at the moment the credential is ACCEPTED.
//
// The hook is INVERTED for the reason helpers.js's setJwtRecorder is: this module
// requires admin_stats.js (it needs the identity normalisation), so admin_stats.js
// cannot require this one back without a cycle, and a cycle in node hands back a
// half-initialised module whose exports are undefined. So admin_stats.js offers a
// slot and this file installs itself in it at require time.
//
// Two identities are skipped, and both are deliberate:
//
//   * an LDAP bind. The identity presented to a bind is a DN — it names an
//     object in this very directory — so creating `uid=cn=admin\,dc=example...`
//     from one would be nonsense. A bind is recorded in the admin console like
//     any other authentication; it just does not seed an entry.
//   * an OAuth CLIENT (client_credentials, client authentication at the token
//     endpoint). A client is not a person, and `ou=users` is for people. The
//     admin console makes the same distinction with its `isClient` flag, which is
//     what this reads.

// A BUG IN ldapjs 3.0.7 THAT THIS FILE ROUTES AROUND, recorded here because the

//
// `SearchResponse.prototype.send(entry)` runs a SECOND attribute filter of its
// own after the handler has already chosen what to send. That filter compares
// the entry's attribute name — LOWER-CASED, as `_a` — against the requested
// list held EXACTLY AS THE CLIENT SENT IT:
//
//     } else if (self.attributes.length &&
//                self.attributes.indexOf(_a) === -1) { delete ... }
//
// So a client asking for `telephoneNumber` gets back everything it asked for
// EXCEPT `telephoneNumber`, because `telephonenumber` is not in `['title',
// 'telephoneNumber', 'cn']`. Every attribute whose conventional spelling has a
// capital in it — telephoneNumber, givenName, displayName, objectClass,
// userPassword — is silently dropped from a SELECTIVE search and from nothing
// else, which is why a search asking for everything looks perfect and why this
// took a while to find. LDAP attribute descriptions are case-insensitive
// (RFC 4512 section 2.5), so it is a defect rather than a convention.
//
// `send()`'s `nofiltering` argument does NOT turn it off, which is the trap
// inside the trap: that flag guards the `_`-prefix and `notAttributes` branches
// above this one, and the requested-attributes branch has no guard at all. Its
// documentation says as much ("skip filtering notAttributes and '_'
// attributes") and reads like it covers everything.
//
// What does turn it off is passing a SearchResultEntry INSTANCE rather than a
// plain `{dn, attributes}` object: `send()` takes an early branch for one and
// writes it untouched. So this function builds the message itself. That is
// correct here rather than merely expedient — the selection has already been
// made below, case-insensitively and with RFC 4511 section 4.5.1.8's rule about
// operational attributes, so a second pass can only remove things it should
// not.
//
// The bug is deliberately NOT fixed in the submodule. node-ldapjs is pinned and
// used UNMODIFIED so that it stays a usable copy of the library rather than a
// fork nobody else can consume, and so that the api and this service are
// running the same code as anybody else's ldapjs. Patching its internals would
// make every future update a merge, and would hide a defect that a real client
// talking to a real ldapjs server still has. If it is ever fixed upstream this
// code is unaffected: it does not depend on the filter being absent, only on
// not being filtered twice.
